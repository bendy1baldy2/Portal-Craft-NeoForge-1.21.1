## 🚀 Overview
**Portal Craft** is a comprehensive overhaul mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 built on **NeoForge**. It meticulously recreates the mechanics, aesthetics, and atmosphere of Valve's *Portal* series. This isn't just a teleportation mod; it's a complete toolkit for building complex, physics-based test chambers.

## ✨ Features

### 🔫 The Portal Device (ASHPD)
*   **Momentum Conservation:** Fly through portals at high speeds just like the original games.
*   **Dual-Link System:** Seamlessly transition between blue and orange portals with zero lag.
*   **Entity Support:** Portals work for players, mobs, dropped items, and even moving blocks.

### 📦 Testing Elements

| Element | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Weighted Cubes** | Classic storage cubes and Companion Cubes for button activation. |
| **Thermal Beams** | Deadly lasers that can be redirected using specialized prisms. |
| **Aerial Faith Plates** | Catapult yourself (or objects) across massive gaps. |
| **Excursion Funnels** | Tractor beams for vertical and horizontal transport. |

### 🧪 Aperture Gels
*   **Repulsion Gel (Blue):** Jump higher and bounce off surfaces.
*   **Propulsion Gel (Orange):** Increase movement speed drastically across painted floors.
*   **Conversion Gel (White):** Turn any surface into a portal-conductive wall.
